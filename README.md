# Covid-19-Detection-System
There are several ways to diagnose COVID-19 positive patients at early stages considering their symptoms as well as with the assistance of pathology test, Computer Tomography (CT) scan. To investigate early symptoms of COVID-19 is not a useful diagnostic procedure since there are some cases where people have the symptoms but are still not COVID-19 infected as confirmed by the pathological test or CT scan. In addition to this, Image classification is also considered one of the biggest problem in the medical field. The major goal of medical image classification is to classify images of the different diseases setting possible labels.
1.3	Project objectives:

The objective of the project work are illustrated below-
1)	To build a CNN model that detects COVID-19 by viewing the chest X-ray images in just few seconds.
2)	To implement objective-driven and sustainable testing strategies for COVID-19 which would support the overall public health responses.
3)	To mitigate its impact on vulnerable populations and healthcare systems, while ensuring that societies and economies can continue to function smoothly.
4)	To decrease the diagnostic time and reduce financial costs
5)	To test the model for the satisfactory performance.

Considering all those factors, we can say that there is a need for effective detection system for COVID-19 detection. As the spread of this deadly virus has increased demonically and taken the lives of many people residing in different countries.

Need of Application:

To overcome the problem of costly CT scans and pathological tests, traditional radiography or Chest X-Ray (CXR) images can be useful because CXR is less costly and has minimal harmful consequences. The modern radiographical machines are affordable for average income countries or underdeveloped countries. Hence, in this project work, CXR is used to identify the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus.
Using a Deep learning approach image classification problem can be solved with the help of transfer learning. Transfer learning is one of the popular approaches in Machine learning which can useful for building an accurate and higher performance model in a short time-span. In computer science, transfer learning is expressed through the utilization of pre-trained model state-of-art CNN models. A pre-trained or previously trained model is a model trained on a large dataset to solve a problem close to the issue investigated in this project.
To solve the problem of chest X-ray classification and to improve the performance of a CNN model, two pre-trained CNN (VGG16 and ResNet50 models) for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) are presented.
